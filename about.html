                <P>During the past three years, I have spent time educating students on the need for professionalism in engineering.
                    Currently <!--now-->, I have just finished my service with Delta State School of Marine Technology (DESOMATECH), Burutu, where I served as a graduate assistant. 
                    I was tasked with lecturing in the following courses: engineering measurements, naval architecture and mechanical engineering science 1 and 2 (statics and dynamics);
                    this I delivered to the satisfaction of both my employers and my audience, demonstrating the theories of engineering through practical experiences.
                    Apart from being able to harness the potentials of the weaker ones amongst my subordinates, I am also able to quell tension and broker peace between parties of conflict.
                    While I was serving as a corps member in Burutu town, in the year 2021, there was tension between the Local Government Inspector (LGI) and the leader of the unit. 
                    It seemed as if it would turn worse, until I stepped in and took over the mantle of leadership. The transition was so smooth that many forgot what had happened initially.
                    I spearheaded the national sanitation day, information collection and subsequent clearances; in all of these events, there was no tension nor quarrel.
                </P>
                <p>This was a quality experience, one to take note of.</p>
